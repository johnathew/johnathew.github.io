            <Text fw={300} style={breakStyles}> I am currently working as a Helpdesk Specialist contracted by the CDC and am looking to transition into a career as a Front End Developer.</Text>

            <Text fw={300} style={breakStyles}>Initially with my degree, I had planned to pursue a career in medicine. Towards the end of my sophomore year, I recognized that I was not passionate about the discipline; however, I felt too invested and decided to push through and continue my studies. After graduation, feeling burnt out and jaded but still unwilling to give up, I decided to pursue a career as a pharmacist. I began working as a pharmacy technician where I very quickly realized being a pharmacist was something I had no interest in doing. The next four years were spent trying different avenues in which I could utilize my degree and still be successful. Some of these included: EMT training, graduate school, and even a career in the military.</Text>

            <Text fw={300} style={breakStyles}> In the fall of 2021, after a very difficult but necessary conversation with myself, I decided to finally follow through on a path that I felt passionate about. Something that was done only for myself and not to please others. I decided to pursue a career in web development.</Text>

            <Text fw={300} style={breakStyles}> Art and creativity have always been something I admired and loved; however, they always fell onto the backburner due to pressure from family and friends to pursue a more "practical" career. Upon receiving guidance from a friend who currently works as a software engineer, I decided to pursue a career in web development, a field in which I could express my artistic abilities and challenge my own creativity. </Text>

            <Text fw={300} style={breakStyles}>Primarily using free online resources, I became proficient with HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, and React. Utilizing these skills, I created a few projects to showcase my abilities and even created this website to serve as a portfolio.</Text>

            <Text fw={300} style={breakStyles}> I am currently looking for a position as a Front End Developer and am open to any opportunities. I am also open to any advice or guidance from anyone who has been in a similar situation as me.</Text>

            <Text fw={300}>Thank you for your time and consideration.</Text>
